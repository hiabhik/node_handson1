<p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It is commonly used to build server-side applications, but can also be used to build command-line tools and other types of applications.</p>
